This is a fun little POC for a Rust service layer. Click on my cute friend to make sure you have the latest version of Rust and Cargo.

I use a Linux machine so feel free to tweak these steps but the way I run this POC is by doing the following.

If you don't have docker on your computer now would be a great time to get it. 

https://www.docker.com/

make sure you have docker on your machine.

`docker -v`

cd to your app directory and open the terminal in your IDE

start docker.

`sudo systemctl start docker`

check and see if the docker daemon is running

`sudo docker ps -a`

build and start the postgres db docker container

`docker compose up`

use diesel to run the migration which will add the greeting to the first row of the db.

`diesel migration run`

The table stucture is the exact same as the Diesel getting started example.

run the application, and see the greeting.

`cargo run`
